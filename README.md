Computing Fractal Dimension of Coastlines Using FIF

* This is the code for the thesis work I am doing under Dr. Akhlaq Hussain Sir.

* In short, the thesis work is to design a novel algorithm for computing th fractal dimension using Fractal Interpolation Function(FIF) method.

* I uploaded the .ipynb and .py versions of the code but I highly recommend you to checkout the .ipynb version because it is organized properly. If it is 
  taking too long to load, then checkout the .py version.

* Finally, we demonstrated the algorithm using KSA coastlines. The coastline points are in .csv files attached.
